## Quick Start

To install Drizzle Vue Plugin, first create a Vue app within a Truffle project. See **[this example project](https://github.com/trufflesuite/drizzle-vue-plugin)** for a better understanding of how to structure your app.

Inside the root of your Vue app, run:

```
npm install --save @drizzle/vue-plugin
```
